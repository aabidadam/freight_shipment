# Shipment Delay Prediction

## Problem Statement
In the competitive world of freight logistics, timely deliveries are critical for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Delays in shipments can result in significant losses for businesses and disrupt the supply chain. The aim of this project is to build an AI model capable of predicting whether a shipment will be delayed or on time based on historical data. This predictive solution helps logistics companies to proactively manage delays and optimize their operations.

## Solution
This project involves building a machine learning classification model to predict shipment delays. The project is structured in the following steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Null values in the dataset were identified and treated using appropriate imputation techniques.
- **Data Transformation:** Categorical features were encoded, and numerical features were scaled as necessary to make the dataset suitable for modeling.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between features.
- Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps were generated to gain insights into the data.

### 3. Model Training
Two models were trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression:** A simple and interpretable model used as a baseline.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** A more robust and complex model, which provided better performance in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

The **Random Forest Classifier** outperformed Logistic Regression and was selected as the final model for deployment. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.

### 4. Deployment
- The final model was saved using **Pickle**, a Python library for serializing and deserializing objects.
- A **Flask** web application was developed to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input shipment data and receive predictions on whether the shipment will be delayed or on time.

### 5. Repository Structure
The complete codebase, including data cleaning, EDA, model training, and Flask integration, is available in this GitHub repository. Key files and directories include:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and model training.
- `models/`: Serialized model files (Pickle format).
- `app/`: Flask application code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` and input shipment details to get predictions.

## Results
The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, outperforming Logistic Regression by Y%. The detailed evaluation metrics are documented in the EDA and model training notebooks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to solve real-world problems in logistics. By predicting shipment delays, this solution can help businesses improve their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
